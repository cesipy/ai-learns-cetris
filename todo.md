# todo

- [ ] open fifos only once in python
- [ ] convert char to std::string (+ other cpp functionalities)
- [x] gravity_skip() after python sends a control. AI should only make one guess.
- [ ] further refactor modules (e.g. logger.cpp for logging, ...)
- [x] proper exit of tetris (when 'q' or game finished): here we have to close the fifo_control in python, after 'end' is receieved
